#!/usr/bin/env bash
# burndown-parallel.sh — the v2 contract: parallel lanes, single-file ratchet.
#
# Lanes sculpt in WORKTREE-ISOLATED clones of a git tree, over PAIRWISE-
# DISJOINT suites (`next --lanes` guarantees no two lanes share a ledger or
# prose). The FEDERATED GATE IS THE SERIALIZATION POINT: candidates land on
# the real tree one at a time; each landing must turn its gap's probe GREEN
# and keep the fleet gate green, then is committed; a candidate that fails is
# REVERTED AND DISCARDED — its gap returns to the backlog for a fresh attempt
# against the new baseline. Never merge two sculpts.
#
# Agent contract (per lane): $AGENT_CMD is invoked with the cycle prompt on
# stdin and env LANE_GAP, LANE_TREE (the lane's worktree — sculpt ONLY
# there), RECURVE_RESULT_FILE (write the run record JSON). Promotion is the
# ORCHESTRATOR's, after the gated landing — a lane never edits the ledger.
#
# Knobs (env > stamped defaults): AGENT_CMD (required), PARALLEL, CAP
# (rounds), TREE_DIR, RECURVE_BIN, GIT_USER_NAME/EMAIL.
#
# NOTE on rebuilds: if a suite's probes read built artifacts, set its
# `rebuild` and run it between landing and gate (the stale check will
# otherwise rightly refuse the verdict). Engine-from-source projects skip it.
#
# NOTE on decompose (docs/plans/autonomous_solver.md): landing here checks
# `probe --gap $GAP` for READY→close — i.e. it only recognizes a lane that
# closed its own gap directly. A lane that instead broke $GAP down RED-first
# (RUN.md §DECOMPOSE: new sub-claims + a sufficiency-checked assembly,
# covers_claim-linked) will NOT show READY→close for $GAP itself, so its
# diff is discarded here even if the decomposition itself is sound — safe
# (nothing false lands), just not yet recognized as a valid parallel landing.
# Decompose is supported by the SEQUENTIAL loop (burndown.sh/burndown.js,
# RUN.md, the `loop`/`cycle` skills); a lane wanting to break a gap down
# should report `failed` here and let a sequential cycle pick it up instead,
# until this runner's landing check learns to recognize an assembly-GREEN
# decomposition as its own kind of landing.

honest attempts then report failed.
