// burndown.js — orchestrator-runtime twin of workflows/burndown.sh.
// Deterministic control flow lives HERE; judgment lives in the agents. The
// same contract must stay runnable as the dumb shell loop (burndown.sh) so
// the loop is never married to one harness — RUN.md is the portability layer.
//
// Hard-won rules encoded below (each was paid for):
//  - park-and-continue: an un-greenable gap never halts the fleet
//  - watchdogs: cap, consecutive failures, runaway scope (net-gap-positive)
//  - structured results only: schema-validated, never free text
//  - the cycle prompt embeds the non-negotiable rules (agents are stateless)
//  - a timed-out/dead agent is a failed cycle, not a hang (results tolerate null)
//  - resume: relaunch with resumeFromRunId — completed cycles return cached
//
// Parallel burndown (v2): implemented in workflows/burndown-parallel.sh —
// worktree-isolated lanes over disjoint suites (`next --lanes`); the gate is
// the serialization point (gap GREEN + fleet gate per landing); failing
// candidates are reverted and discarded, re-run fresh against the new
// baseline. Never merge two sculpts. This sequential script remains the v1
// default; reach for lanes when wall-clock matters and suites are disjoint.
