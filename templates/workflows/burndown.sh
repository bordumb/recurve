#!/usr/bin/env bash
# burndown.sh — the portable unattended loop. Deterministic control flow in
# this script; judgment in the agents. Works with ANY agent harness via one
# contract:
#
#   $AGENT_CMD is invoked once per cycle with the cycle prompt on stdin.
#   It must sculpt exactly one gap per {{RUN_CONTRACT}} and write a run-record JSON
#   (schema/run-record.schema.json) to the path in $RECURVE_RESULT_FILE.
#   Its exit code is ignored; only the record and the gate are believed.
#
# Waves: when the strict ledger empties but drafts pend in gaps.draft.yaml,
# the loop ARMS the next wave — one agent authors probes + traps for a batch
# of drafts (never product code), then `baseline` measures them for real and
# promotes RED ones as open work. Arming never happens while ADJUDICATE.md
# has pending forks: a probe must encode a human decision, never a guess.
# Launching this loop is your sign-off that you have skimmed the drafts.
