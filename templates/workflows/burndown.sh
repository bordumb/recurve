# burndown.sh — the portable unattended loop. Deterministic control flow in
# this script; judgment in the agents. Works with ANY agent harness via one
# contract:
#
#   $AGENT_CMD is invoked once per cycle with the cycle prompt on stdin.
#   It must sculpt exactly one gap per .recurve/RUN.md and write a run-record JSON
#   (schema/run-record.schema.json) to the path in $RECURVE_RESULT_FILE.
#   Its exit code is ignored; only the record and the gate are believed.
#
# Knobs (env > config defaults):
#   AGENT_CMD       (required) the agent invocation
#   CAP             max cycles                       [default {{CAP}}]
#   MAX_FAILS       consecutive-failure halt         [default {{MAX_FAILS}}]
#   RUNAWAY         net-gap-positive-cycle halt      [default {{RUNAWAY}}]
#   PARKED_SEED     comma-separated gap ids to park before starting
#
# Halts ONLY on: no-work-left, cap, runaway scope, consecutive failures, or
# a lock refusal. An un-greenable gap is parked, never fatal.
